First, when using Photosite Flickr, you can limit your search to commercial use and modifications allowed. 

When using Google Images, click on the Tools menu, then Usage Rights and Creative Commons licenses. Check each individual image for its license, and make sure it's not labeled as non-commercial (NC) or no derivative uses (ND). If an image has a CC0 public domain mark, that's acceptable.
