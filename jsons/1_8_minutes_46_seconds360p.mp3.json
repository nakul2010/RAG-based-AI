Yet to seize the meaning of this day, we must recall darker times. Three and a half centuries ago, the first Negroes arrived at Jamestown. They did not arrive in brave ships in search of a home for freedom. They did not mingle fear and joy in expectation that in this new world anything would be possible to a man strong enough to reach for it. They came in darkness and they came in chains. And today, we strike away the last major shackle of those fierce and ancient bonds. And let us remember that it is not always so. And let us remember that it is not always so. The stories of our nation and of the American Negro are like two great rivers. Welling up from that tiny Jamestown spring, they flow through the river and the river. And let us remember that it is not always so. The stories of our nation and of the American Negro are like two great rivers. Welling up from that tiny Jamestown spring, they flow through the centuries along divided channels. When pioneers subdued a continent to the need of man, they did not tame it for the Negro. When the Liberty Bell rang out in Philadelphia, it did not toll to the Negro. When Andrew Jackson threw open the doors of democracy, they did not open for the Negro. It was only at Appomattox a century ago that an American victory was also a Negro victory. And the two rivers, one shining with promise, the other dark stained with oppression, began to move toward one another. Yet for almost a century, the promise of that day was not fulfilled. Today is a towering and certain mark that in this generation, that promise will be kept. In our time, the two currents will finally mingle and rush as one great stream across the uncertain and the marvelous years of the America that is yet to come. This act flows from a clear and simple wrong. Its only purpose is to right that wrong. The right is to right that wrong is the right that no American can justify. The right is one which no American in his heart can justify. The right is one which no American true to our principles can deny. In 1957, as the leader of the majority in the United States Senate, speaking and supporting legislation to guarantee to the right of all men a right to the right of all men, a right to the right of all men. I said, this right to vote is the basic right without which all others are meaningless. It gives people, people as individuals control over their own destinies. Last year, I said, until every qualified person, regardless of the color of his skin, has the right, unquestioned and unrestrained, to go in and cast his ballot in every precinct in this great land of ours. I said, I am not going to be satisfied. Immediately after the election, I directed the Attorney General to explore as rapidly as possible the ways to ensure the right to vote. And then, last March, with the outrage of Selma still fresh, I came down to this Capitol one evening and asked the Congress and the people for swift and for sweeping action to guarantee to every man and woman the right to vote. In less than 48 hours, I sent the voting rights act of 1965 to the Congress. In a little more than four months, the Congress, with overwhelming majorities, enacted one of the most monumental laws in the entire history of American freedom. We still have a long, long way to go.
